              <p className="mb-6">As we step into 2025, the world of design continues to evolve, merging technology, creativity, and user experience into something even more immersive and interactive. From cutting-edge digital interfaces to a resurgence of nostalgic aesthetics, designers are pushing boundaries like never before. Let’s explore the key design trends that will shape 2025 across various industries.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">1. AI-Driven Design Evolution</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Artificial intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept; it's an integral part of modern design workflows. In 2025, AI-assisted design tools will become more advanced, offering intuitive automation while preserving creative control. Designers will use AI to generate complex layouts, create personalized user experiences, and even optimize accessibility in real time.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">2. Mixed Reality (MR) Interfaces</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">With the rapid adoption of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) interfaces are set to become mainstream. Expect to see MR applied in e-commerce, gaming, education, and interactive storytelling, where users can engage with content in more intuitive ways.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">3. Neo-Brutalism in UI/UX</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">A modern twist on classic brutalist design, Neo-Brutalism embraces raw, bold, and unpolished aesthetics while maintaining a user-friendly approach. Harsh contrasts, rigid grids, and asymmetry will take center stage in websites, apps, and digital branding.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">4. Hyper-Personalization & Dynamic Content</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Websites and applications will leverage real-time data to customize layouts, colors, and content based on user behavior. AI-generated dynamic elements, adaptive typography, and theme-shifting UI will ensure that no two users experience the same interface in the same way.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">5. Sustainable & Ethical Design</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">From digital carbon footprint reduction to sustainable packaging, designers are making conscious choices that align with environmentally friendly values. Ethical UX practices, including inclusive design for diverse audiences, will also gain prominence.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">6. 3D & Isometric Design Renaissance</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Three-dimensional elements are making a comeback. Advances in WebGL and CSS transformations are making it easier to integrate 3D directly into web design, adding depth and realism to digital interfaces.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">7. Motion & Kinetic Typography</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Typography is no longer static. Motion-based typography enhances storytelling and engagement through hover animations, micro-interactions, and fully animated text sections.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">8. Retro-Futurism & Nostalgic Aesthetics</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Retro-futurism, inspired by 80s and 90s aesthetics, will blend pixel art, neon palettes, and glitch effects with modern design principles—tapping into nostalgia while looking forward.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">9. Dark Mode-First Design</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Dark mode will become the default rather than an optional feature. This design shift supports energy-efficient displays and improves accessibility in low-light environments.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">10. Experimental Navigation & Scroll Experiences</h2>
              <p className="mb-6">Designers are breaking away from standard navigation. Expect to see horizontal scrolling, parallax effects, and AI-powered navigation enhancing immersive experiences.</p>

              <div className="bg-[#e5ed0536] border-l-4 border-white p-6 my-8">
                <p className="text-white">"2025 is shaping up to be a year where design seamlessly integrates with technology, culture, and sustainability."</p>
              </div>

              <p className="mb-6">Whether you’re a designer, developer, or brand strategist, staying ahead of these trends will be crucial for crafting compelling, future-forward designs.</p>
